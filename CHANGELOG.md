# Changelog

All notable changes to Sleep Diaries will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

---

## [1.1.3] — 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Entry date prompt**: participants completing entries between midnight and 14:00 are now asked which day the entry belongs to (today or yesterday) before starting the questionnaire. This correctly attributes data for night owls, delayed sleep phase, and anyone who goes to bed after midnight — without relying on arbitrary fixed cutoffs. The evening card gate is now date-pair-aware, checking whether the morning entry for the *same candidate date* exists rather than always checking today’s date.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Evening diary blocked after morning entry**: context state was not refreshed before navigating back to the home screen; on slower Android devices the home screen could render with stale `todayStatus`, incorrectly locking the evening card
- **Evening diary unavailable after ~21:00 in Brazil**: date strings were computed from UTC (`toISOString()`), causing entries made after 21:00 local time (UTC-3) to be assigned to the following day; replaced with a `getLocalDateStr()` helper that uses device local time throughout `saveEntry`, `isTodayComplete`, and `loadTodayStatus`
- **Android question text not updating between steps**: `ScrollView` in `QuestionnaireScreen` was not resetting scroll position on question change, leaving previous question text visible above the fold; added a `scrollTo({ y: 0 })` effect keyed to `currentIndex`
- **Service worker cache not busting on deploy**: cache version string was hardcoded and never incremented; `deploy.sh` now injects the app version from `package.json` at build time; `sed` command made cross-platform compatible (macOS and Linux/Netlify)

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- **Minute stepper — one-time questionnaires**: time inputs in `QuestionnaireScreen` and `QuestionnaireModal` now tap ±5 min and hold ±1 min, matching the daily diary behaviour
- **Onboarding nav buttons**: Back button uses glassmorphic style consistent with the rest of the app; Next/Get Started button gains shadow and semi-transparent amber fill

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Unit test suite — questionnaire scoring**: comprehensive tests for all eight one-time questionnaire instruments (ESS, ISI, DBAS-16, MEQ, PSQI, RU-SATED, STOP-BANG, MCTQ) covering score computation, boundary conditions, and interpretation labels
- **Unit test suite — JSON export consistency**: structural validation of `exportToJSON` output, field-format checks (clock, duration, medication), round-trip fidelity, and import edge cases

### Fixed

- **MEQ items 11 and 12**: corrected option values to match the original Horne & Östberg (1976) paper — item 11 now scores 6/4/2/0 and item 12 scores 0/2/3/5, raising the maximum achievable score to 86
- **PSQI scoring**: corrected sleep duration boundary (`>7` → `≥7`), sleep efficiency formula, and disturbance thresholds to match the official Buysse et al. (1989) scoring algorithm; maximum score now correctly displayed as `/21`
- **PSQI result display**: maximum score was incorrectly calculated by summing raw item option values (giving `/39`); now uses the published maximum of 21 via `maxScore` property
- **RU-SATED**: fully rewritten to match official Ru-SATED v4.0 — 6 items (not 7), 0–4 response scale (Never/Rarely/Sometimes/Often/Always), maximum score 24, corrected item wording; interpretation thresholds updated accordingly
- **MCTQ MSFsc formula**: corrected to compare SD_F vs SD_W (not SD_week) per Roenneberg et al.; social jetlag now uses circular (shorter arc) arithmetic to handle midnight-straddling schedules, fixing erroneous values such as 24.0 h
- **Questionnaire results not showing**: `resultsUnlocked` was passed as a stale route param from `QuestionnairesScreen` (evaluated before `morningCount` loaded from storage); `QuestionnaireScreen` now loads entry count independently, resolving the issue where results only appeared after visiting the Final Report screen
- **Service worker cache**: bumped cache version from `v1` to `v2` to force a full cache bust on existing PWA installations, ensuring updated JS bundles are served

### Improved

- **One-time questionnaire steppers**: time, duration, and number steppers in `QuestionnaireModal` now support long-press repeat (150 ms interval), matching the behaviour of the daily diary steppers
- **Beta flags removed**: ESS, ISI, DBAS-16, MEQ, PSQI, RU-SATED, STOP-BANG, and MCTQ are now considered stable; beta flags and banners removed from all eight instruments
- **Questionnaire footnote**: removed the opening "These questionnaires are experimental" sentence; retained the methodological caveat and licensing reference
- **MCTQ**: removed beta flag following scoring correction

---
## [1.1.0-beta.2] — 2026-04-24

### Improved

- **Questionnaire UI refresh**: daily (morning/evening) and one-time questionnaire screens fully modernised — glassy progress bar, yes/no, rating and number buttons with soft shadows; themed tint on progress track for contrast; glassy Back button; shadow lift on Next button; borderless unselected button states throughout
- **Minor visual polish**: button shadow depths increased across questionnaire screens; progress icon and track borders softened to match glassy language

---

## [1.2.0-beta.1] — 2026-04-24

### Improved

- **UI modernisation — glassy card system**: unified semi-transparent card treatment (`rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`) with white borders and blue-tinted shadows applied across all screens; replaces hard `borderWidth: 1.5` / `#B0CCEE` borders throughout
- **Home screen**: instructions card and bottom shortcut cards (Past Entries, Final Report) refreshed with glassy treatment, icon pills, and inline label + chevron rows
- **Tab bar**: labels added (Home / Diary / Settings; EN + PT-BR), semi-transparent background with blur on web, upward shadow, refined inactive colour
- **Diary tab**: streak banner and stat chips refreshed; streak emoji replaced with themed flame icon (orange when active, blue when zero); stat box labels shortened to prevent wrapping
- **Login screen**: logo added as a soft footer element; glassy inputs; dynamic CTA button colour (grey → blue based on input)
- **Final report**: blurred home gradient background with white overlay; battery-half icon for morning restedness; sleep quality swapped to blue star
- **Profile modal**: full-screen gradient background with overlay; glassy edit inputs and action buttons
- **Past entries**: glassy entry cards; orange uppercase date labels; icon pills for morning/evening
- **Questionnaires screen**: blue-tinted borderless Start/Redo buttons
- **Daily questionnaire**: glassy progress bar, yes/no, rating, and number buttons; themed tint on progress track; glassy Back button; shadow on Next button
- **One-time questionnaire modal**: gradient background with purple overlay; glassy progress bar, scale buttons, instructions box, and nav buttons; purple border only on selected state
- **Export, Medications, Sleep Metrics, Questionnaire Credits, Threshold References screens**: all modernised with glassy cards and shadow headers
- **`expo-blur`**: added as a dependency for blur effects on the final report and profile modal

## [1.1.0-beta.1] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Final report — share card**: shareable image card showing all sleep metrics in a 2×4 grid with threshold-coloured stat chips; works on native (via `react-native-view-shot` + `expo-sharing`) and web PWA
- **Final report — thresholds**: metric chips now colour-coded against clinical reference values
- **Export screen**: modernised with glassy cards and a shadow header
- **Medication dose stepper**: 5 mg increment stepper added to medication dose input
- **Alcohol question**: standard drink definition hint added to the diary alcohol question
- **SVG backgrounds**: PNG background assets replaced with adaptive SVG components via `react-native-svg`
- **Unit test suite**: tests for storage helpers, stat computations, sleep metrics, and i18n; run automatically on every push via GitHub Actions
- **CI badge**: test status badge added to README

### Improved

- **Home screen**: entry card aspect ratio fixed; improved medication UX
- **Profile and questionnaire modals**: constrained to app width on web
- **Fathom analytics**: SPA page tracking enabled via `data-spa=auto`
- **Stability**: all AsyncStorage operations wrapped in try/catch with safe JSON parsing
- **Accessibility**: accessible labels added throughout; decorative emoji hidden from screen readers; colour-only distinctions resolved
- **Performance**: heavy computations memoised to avoid redundant re-renders on re-render
- **Architecture**: entry state centralised in `EntriesContext`; `MIN_ENTRIES` threshold and `computeStats` moved to `utils/`

### Fixed

- Entry button distortion on web and profile layout issues
- Duplicate i18n questionnaire keys that broke Back/Next buttons
- PWA splash dismissal on Android (`display-mode` standalone detection)
